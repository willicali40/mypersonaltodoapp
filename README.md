# Personal Todo App

This is a personal Todo App that I use on a daily basis. The app is made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript vanilla. It allows me to create tasks, mark them as completed, delete them, and filter them from the footer buttons: all, completed, and pending. The app is optimized only for mobile screen sizes, not for tablets and PC.

## Usage

To use this app, simply open the `index.html` file in your browser. You will be presented with a simple interface that allows you to manage your tasks.

### Adding tasks

To add a task, simply click on the input field at the top of the screen and type in the task you want to add. Press enter to add the task to your list.

### Marking tasks as completed

To mark a task as completed, simply click on the checkbox next to the task you want to mark as completed. The task will be crossed out to indicate that it has been completed.

### Deleting tasks

To delete a task, simply click on the x icon next to the task you want to delete. The task will be removed from your list.

### Filtering tasks

To filter your tasks, simply click on one of the footer buttons: all, completed, or pending. The app will filter your tasks accordingly.

### Saving data

The data for this app is stored in your browser, so even if you close the window or tab, the app will render the same tasks and info that you had before closing the tab.
IMPORTANT: If you open it in another browser, diferent data will be store there and you will not get same data from the first browser.
